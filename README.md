# Weather App

The implementation of a simple modern website that shows the current date, time and weather for Paris, Ontario (in degrees Celsius) along with
pages and navigation bar for About Us, Services, and Our Customer (each page only contains place holder text for demostration purposes).

Using the Open Weather Map API, an asynchronous data fecthing method was used to get the data.
