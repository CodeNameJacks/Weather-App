# Weather App

The implementation of a simple modern website that shows the current date, time and weather for Paris, Ontario (in degrees Celsius) along with
pages and a navigation bar for About Us, Services, and Our Customers (each page only contains place holder text for demonstration purposes).

Using the Open Weather Map API, an asynchronous data fetching method was used to get the data.

This demonstrates the set up and running of a Vue application and the integration of third-party APIs to retrieve data.
